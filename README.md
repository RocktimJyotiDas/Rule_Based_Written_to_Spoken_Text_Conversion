# Rule_Based_Written_to_Spoken_Text_Conversion
The goal of the assignment is to write a written to spoken text converter.
The input of the code will be a set of tokenized sentences, and the output will be conversions
where date, time, and numerical quantities are rewritten in the way they will be spoken. e.g. All abbreviations are separated as they are spoken. Example, “U.S.” or “US” is converted to “u s”, all dates are converted into words. Example, “29 March 2012” will be converted to “the twenty ninth of march twenty twelve”. “2011-01-25” will be converted to “the twenty fifth of january twenty eleven”.
